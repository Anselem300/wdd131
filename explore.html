            <p>Join Us as we briefly walk you through some of the best places to visit in Nigeria, finding the best
                place when it comes to hospitality and what languages are spoken in the country. However, it is important to note that 
                protected areas 
                such as Cross River National Park and Yankari National Park have 
                waterfalls, dense rainforest, savanna and rare primate habitats. One of the most recognizable 
                sites is Zuma Rock, a 725m-tall monolith outside the capital of Abuja that is pictured on the 
                national currency. </p>
